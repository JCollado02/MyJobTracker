# üìå MyJobTracker Backend

A **Spring Boot** backend for the **MyJobTracker** application, providing RESTful APIs for tracking job applications. This backend handles data persistence using **PostgreSQL** and follows standard **CRUD operations**.

---

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About This Project
This backend is part of my first full-stack project. As I am currently looking for entry-level positions, I wanted to create a **job application tracker** that helps me stay organized while also building hands-on experience with **Spring Boot, REST APIs, and PostgreSQL**.

It may not be perfect, but it‚Äôs my first public backend project outside of university. I‚Äôm constantly learning and improving, so feedback is always welcome!

## Features
- RESTful API for managing job applications.
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for job applications.
- Uses **Spring Boot**, **Spring Data JPA**, and **PostgreSQL**.
- CORS support for frontend communication.
- Environment-based API configuration using `.env`.
- **Docker-based PostgreSQL database** ensuring data persists across restarts.

## üõ† Setup & Installation

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repo**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/JCollado02/MyJobTracker-BE.git
cd MyJobTracker-BE
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Start PostgreSQL with Docker**
Before running the backend, **ensure Docker is running** and start the PostgreSQL container (if needed):
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file in the project root and define database credentials:

```sh
POSTGRES_USER=username
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Application**
#### **Using IntelliJ IDEA (For Development)**
1. **Start Docker** (if not already running).
2. Open the project in IntelliJ.
3. Click the **Run** button on `MyJobTrackerApplication.java` (the main Spring Boot file).
4. The backend will start and be available at **`http://localhost:8080`**.
